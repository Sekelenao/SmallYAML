## Overview

---

SmallYAML is a simplified YAML library that prioritizes maintainability and predictability over comprehensive YAML
specification coverage. Rather than supporting the full YAML specification, SmallYAML intentionally constrains the
allowed syntax to a carefully chosen subset that eliminates common sources of configuration complexity and parsing
ambiguity.

## Zero Dependency Strategy

---

SmallYAML's philosophy of simplicity extends to its dependency management. 
The system maintains zero runtime dependencies to ensure:

- Deployment simplicity
- Maintenance isolation
- Security
