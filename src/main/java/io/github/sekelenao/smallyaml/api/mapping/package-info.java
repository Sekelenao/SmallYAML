/**
 * Helpers for mapping property values to domain types.
 *
 * <p>This package provides utilities to transform raw string values coming from
 * the document model into strongly typed values used by application code. The
 * mapping utilities are designed to be straightforward and predictable.</p>
 *
 * <p>Because SmallYAML targets a constrained subset of YAML, the mapping
 * helpers operate within that subset and avoid YAML features that introduce
 * ambiguity or complexity.</p>
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
