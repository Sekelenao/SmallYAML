/**
 * Exception types used by the SmallYAML public API.
 *
 * <p>These exceptions report problems encountered while parsing YAML content or
 * accessing document properties. They are designed to be informative and stable
 * for application code to catch and handle.</p>
 *
 * <p>SmallYAML purposefully supports a constrained subset of YAML to keep
 * behavior predictable. Error messages and exception types reflect that subset
 * rather than the full YAML 1.2 specification.</p>
